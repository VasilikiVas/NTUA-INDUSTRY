# Automatic visual defect detection in industrial products using deep learning methods
This repository contains our team's (*NTUA-INDUSTRY*) project for the competition *Industry 4.0* hosted by **crowdpolicy**

## 🏭 Project Description

### Problem Statement

* Quantity and quality automation in *manufacturing* is a demand not a privilege. In this direction, our team proposed a system to resolve the *material quality control* problem. Human Inspection is an error prone \& time consuming process and results in false positives
    * Parts corectly detected as faulty provoke loss in upstream labor, consumables as well as revenue
    * Parts wrongly detected as faulty provoke a market reaction and eventually a unrepairable damage to company's reputation 

* In that direction every automation system that can early detect false positives without human intervation, while being cost-effective for the customer, is preffered.

### Our solution
* We automated defect detection using deep learning, and more specicially convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on steel images, since it is the most important building material of modern times.
